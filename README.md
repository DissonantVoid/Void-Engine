# Void-Engine
Void Engine is a simple 2d game engine built on top of SFML as a personal project

DISCLAMER:
This is a project made by a person who barely has a year and a half of experience with game development and coding in general, it is not recommended as a learning material as it may contain bad coding habbits, buggy structures and unorganized code
